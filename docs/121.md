## 121

Using the [`kobo-to-121`](https://kobo-connect.azurewebsites.net/docs#/default/kobo_to_121_kobo_to_121_post) endpoint, it is possible to save a Kobo submission as a Person Affected (PA) registration in the [121 Portal](https://www.121.global/).

Step by step:

1. Define which questions in the Kobo form need to be saved in which field.
2. [Create a new Kobo REST Service](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/rest_services.html).
3. Insert as `Endpoint URL` `https://kobo-connect.azurewebsites.net/kobo-to-121`.
4. For each question, add a `Custom HTTP Header` that specifies to which entity and field it corresponds to.
   - The header name (left) must correspond to the Kobo column name (not label).
   - The header value (right) must correspond to the field name in 121.

_Special Headers_:

- The headers `url121` is required and corresponds the url of the 121 instance (without trailing `/`, so e.g. https://staging.121.global)
- Headers `username121` and `password121`, corresponding to the 121 username and the 121 password respectively, must be included as well.
- If `programid` is included as a (select one) question, the `XML Value` of the question in Kobo needs to be the corresponding number in the 121 portal, the label can be something else, see below
  ![programId](https://github.com/rodekruis/kobo-connect/assets/39266480/1b0ccf53-2740-4432-b31e-d5cb57d2aac5)
- If `programid` is not included as a question, it needs to be added to the header as a number

See below for an example configuration, in which programId was not included as a question so it is included in the header.

#### Nota Bene
- The 121 API is currently throttled at 3000 submissions per minute. If you expect to go over this limit, please reach out the the 121 platform team.
- If you would like to define which submissions should and should not be send to EspoCRM, you can use the field `skipconnect` in your Kobo form. If the field is set to `1`, the submission will not be send to 121.
